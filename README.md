# Ride Data Analysis

## Dataset Overview
This dataset contains 50,000 records of ride details from a transportation service. The columns include:

- **services**: Type of ride service (e.g., bike, cab, auto, etc.).
- **date** and **time**: Timestamp details of the rides.
- **ride_status**: Status of the ride (completed or cancelled).
- **source** and **destination**: Start and end locations of the rides.
- **duration**: Ride duration in minutes.
- **distance**: Ride distance in kilometers.
- **ride_charge**, **misc_charge**, **total_fare**: Financial details associated with the rides.
- **payment_method**: Mode of payment for completed rides.

Some rows contain missing data for fare-related fields and payment methods.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Plan
Using Python, the following EDA steps will be performed:

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values in financial and payment method columns.
- Convert date and time columns into a unified datetime format for easier analysis.

### 2. Data Visualization
- Analyze ride distribution by type of service, date, and time.
- Visualize the correlation between ride duration, distance, and fare.
- Explore payment method preferences.

### 3. Statistical Insights
- Examine average ride distance and duration by service type.
- Assess the proportion of completed vs. cancelled rides.
- Calculate revenue insights based on fare data.

## Tools and Libraries
The analysis will leverage the following Python libraries:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Datetime**: For handling date and time data.
